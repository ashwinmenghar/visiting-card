              I worked as a web developer, mainly focusing on backend
              development using Laravel for over 2 years. Recently, I started
              learning the MERN stack to transition into a full-stack developer.
              This change reflects my enthusiasm for tackling new challenges and
              keeping up with industry advancements.
              <br />
              During my time in backend development, I specialized in
              technologies like Laravel, PHP, and MySQL, where I built efficient
              and secure web applications. Now, as I delve into frontend
              technologies such as React, Node.js, MongoDB, and Express.js, I
              aim to create dynamic and scalable full-stack projects.
              <br />
              I am currently seeking opportunities in full-stack development
              roles to utilize my extensive backend experience and emerging
              frontend skills in crafting innovative and impactful web
              solutions.
